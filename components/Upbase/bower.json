There are a number of helpers in here, all of which should conform to the following:\n\n- Can be called from a separate stylesheet and not modified in place (ie, themed)\n- Should be tested and compatible with all browsers OR have known and documented compatibility\n- Will think of more guidelines. \n\n### Usage\nThe primary usage for this right now is to deploy it with Yeoman using the Upbase generator found here: https://github.com/Upstatement/generator-upbase/\n\n### If you're not using Yeoman, but still want to install with Bower:\nAdd this line to your `config.rb`:   \n`add_import_path \"./components/upbase/components\"`\n\n\n\n",
