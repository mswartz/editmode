upbase 0.1.0
======

This is a CSS helper library for the stuff we do pretty often. There are a number of helpers in here, all of which should conform to the following:

- Can be called from a separate stylesheet and not modified in place (ie, themed)
- Should be tested and compatible with all browsers OR have known and documented compatibility
- Will think of more guidelines. 

### Usage
The primary usage for this right now is to deploy it with Yeoman using the Upbase generator found here: https://github.com/Upstatement/generator-upbase/

### If you're not using Yeoman, but still want to install with Bower:
Add this line to your `config.rb`:   
`add_import_path "./components/upbase/components"`
